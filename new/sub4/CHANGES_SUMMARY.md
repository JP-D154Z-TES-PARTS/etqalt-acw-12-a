# l_mat.c Generation Summary (Task 4)

## Overview
Generated new etqalt_l_mat.c based on logic differences between:
- Base: etqalt-acw-11-b (M3 compiler)
- New: etqalt-acw-12-a (M4 compiler with CERT C compliance)

## Changes Applied

### 1. Version Identifier Update
- Changed from: `etqalt-pcw00-1100-b-M3`
- Changed to: `etqalt-pcw00-1100-a-M4`

### 2. Compiler Version Update (CERT C Compliance)
- Old compiler version range: 201355 to 201400
- New compiler version range: 201714 to 201800
- Purpose: Support newer GHS compiler with CERT C compliance

### 3. MK32_ID Definition Update
- Changed from: `0x00000040` (R9 compiler)
- Changed to: `0x00000080` (M4 compiler)

### 4. Logic Preservation
The core logic remains unchanged as the base version (acw-11-b) already correctly
implements the rotation speed correction feature:
- The code properly checks `u1t_xkne_use_c` (etqalt_XKNE_USE switch)
- When ON: applies rotation speed correction
- When OFF: uses direct torque value

The acw-12-a specification update only clarifies the documentation of this
existing logic - no actual logic changes were needed.

## Files Generated

1. `new/sub4/etqalt_l_mat.c` - Updated C source file
2. `new/sub4/etqalt.h` - Header file (copied from base)

Both files are saved with CP932 encoding to properly display Japanese comments.

## Verification

The generated code:
- Maintains all function signatures
- Preserves processing flow
- Keeps all variable declarations
- Maintains compile compatibility
- Uses proper CERT C compliant compiler settings
